%--
%-- To use this package, put
%--   \usepackage{hyperlatex}
%--   \usepackage{rhxpanel}
%-- into the preample of your LaTeX file.
%--
%-- Although this panel is intended to show 4 buttons at the top and
%-- the bottom of each page (the default behaviour), it can be
%-- customised to other styles, see below.
%-- 1) The HOME button. Go immediately back to the initial page.
%-- 2) The PREV button. Go one page back.
%-- 3) The UP   button. Go up one hierarchy.
%-- 4) The NEXT button. Go one page forward.
%-- The behaviour of the PREV and NEXT buttons can be controlled with
%-- the standard sequential.hlx package of Hyperlatex.
%--
%-- Panel fields can be added like in bluepanels.hlx using the command
%--   \htmlpanelfield{TEXT}{LABEL}.
%--
%-- The colour of the panel can be customised by defining the colours
%-- panelcolor and paneltextcolor like this:
%--   \definecolor{panelcolor}{rgb}{1,1,0.8}
%--   \definecolor{panelcolor}{gray}{0.7}  (default)
%--   \definecolor{paneltextcolor}{gray}{0} (default)
%-- See the color package for more details.
%--
%-- The place of the panel buttons is controlled by defining the
%-- command
%--   \newcommand{\HlxIcons}{http://www.cs.uu.nl/\~{}otfried/img/}
%-- The following setting is the default.
%--   \renewcommand{\HlxIcons}{pics/}
%-- Whereas the first specifies a fixed place in the Internet, the
%-- second form describes a local directory starting at
%-- \htmldirectory. A slash will be added automatically to the path if
%-- it is not provided.
%--
%-- The default extension of the button icons is .png, but you can
%-- change this by re-defining
%--   \newcommand{\HlxIconExtension}{gif}
%--
%-- There are several commands to control the generation of buttons.
%-- Here is a list of commands that you can put into your LaTeX file.
%-- \newcommand{\HlxPanelHome}{0}
%--     Don't generate the HOME button.
%-- \newcommand{\HlxPanelHome}{1}                         (default)
%--     Generate a HOME button.
%-- \newcommand{\HlxPanelShade}{0}
%--     Inactive buttons are not shown.
%-- \newcommand{\HlxPanelShade}{1}                        (default)
%--     Inactive buttons appear shaded (the buttons noprevious.png,
%--     noup.png, nonext.png are used).
%-- \newcommand{\HlxPanelPreviousBeforeNext}{0}
%--     The order of the navigation buttons is NEXT, UP, PREVIOUS.
%-- \newcommand{\HlxPanelPreviousBeforeNext}{1}           (default)
%--     The order of the navigation buttons is PREVIOUS, UP, NEXT.
%--
%-- The icons are not part of the package. They are just packaged as
%-- examples. One should provide 7 buttons, home.png, previous.png,
%-- up.png, next.png, noprevious.png, noup.png, nonext.png. The
%-- filename extension depends on what you define in
%-- \HlxIconExtension.
%--
%-- The bluepanels.hlx version which comes with Hyperlatex 2.6 is
%-- emulated by putting
%--   \definecolor{panelcolor}{rgb}{0.7,0.8,1}
%--   \definecolor{paneltextcolor}{gray}{0}
%--   \newcommand{\HlxIcons}{http://www.cs.uu.nl/\~{}otfried/img/}
%--   \newcommand{\HlxIconExtension}{gif}
%--   \newcommand{\HlxPanelHome}{0}
%--   \newcommand{\HlxPanelShade}{0}
%--   \newcommand{\HlxPanelPreviousBeforeNext}{0}
%-- in the preample of your LaTeX file or (at your option) into your
%-- init.hlx file.
%--
%-- This package also contains some code to control the appearance of
%-- the navigation panel. If you load the frames package before
%-- rhxpanel.hlx then you will have a slightly different appearance
%-- than in the case that you first load rhxpanel.hlx and then
%-- frames.hxl. I suggest the following:
%--   \W\usepackage{frames}
%--   \usepackage{color}
%--   \W\usepackage{rhxpanel}
%--   \W\usepackage{rhxxname}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%-- We need color support.
\usepackage{color} \definecolor{panelcolor}{gray}{0.7}
\definecolor{paneltextcolor}{gray}{0}

\typeout{Using Ralf Hemmecke's Panel Format for Hyperlatex 2.7}
\newcommand{\rhxpanelloaded}{1}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%-- All the \HlxEval things here can be removed if rhxxname.hlx makes
%-- it into the core hyperlatex.el.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%-- In order to have a way to refer to the top entry node of the
%-- document we introduce the command \HlxTopNodeUrl which can be used
%-- like \HlxPrevUrl, \HlxNextUrl, usw. The command \HlxHomeUrl is by
%-- default defined as
%--   \newcommand{\HlxHomeUrl}{\HlxTopNodeUrl}
%-- and used for the link underlying the HOME button. Redefine it as
%-- you need.
%--
%-- NOTE: There is a similar command in rhxxname.hlx. If this package
%-- is used in connection with rhxxname.hlx, be sure to load the
%-- packages in correct order. You should say:
%--
%-- \W\usepackage{color}
%-- \W\usepackage{rhxpanel}
%-- \W\usepackage{rhxxname}
%--
%-- in order to overload the following function and use the one
%-- from the rhxxname.hlx package.

\HlxEval{
(put 'HlxTopNodeUrl     'hyperlatex 'hyperlatex-format-hlxtopnodeurl)
(defun hyperlatex-format-hlxtopnodeurl ()
  "Return the URL of the entry point (home) relative to the current place"
  (insert (concat hyperlatex-basename (hyperlatex-html-ext))))
}
\newcommand{\HlxHomeUrl}{\HlxTopNodeUrl}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%-- This gives the URL of the icons. If the given string starts with
%-- "http:", it is considered absolute. Otherwise the string is
%-- treated as a relative directory anchored at \htmldirectory.
%--
%-- NOTE: The functions will be overridden in rhxxname.hlx. 
%-- hyperlatex-format-icon differs from hyperlatex-format-img
%-- (hyperlatex.el) only in the definition of url.
